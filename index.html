            <h2>Syntax Guide</h2>
            <p>
                First of all, thank you for using this changelog generator, even just to play around
                in it. I know the syntax can be a bit confusing, so I've created this guide to help
                you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important thing to know about the syntax is that it's broken up into
                <b>rules</b>. Every line is it's own rule, and for a rule to have any output it
                needs to have a <b>string</b>. A string is text that is wrapped inside
                <b>double quotes</b> (<code>"</code>).
            </p>
            <p>For example, if I used a rule such as:</p>
            <pre><code>"# Changelog"</code></pre>
            <p>It would output:</p>
            <pre><code># Changelog</code></pre>
            <p>
                But this isn't very exciting, is it? You're just telling it text in a complicated
                way, only for it to output that exact thing. And how do we put in the commits?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where <b>conditionals</b> come in. A conditional is a
                <b>commit type</b> wrapped in square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>). A
                conditional checks for if a commit with that commit type exists, and if it does, it
                will output the string. However, if it doesn't find any matching commits, that rule
                will be skipped and you won't get any outputs from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, let's say I want to simply say if there were bugs fixed. I can do
                something like:
            </p>
            <pre><code>[fix] "There was a bug fixed in this update."</code></pre>
            <p>
                If no bugs were fixed, it will not output that. But what if I want to say that there
                were no bugs fixed?
            </p>
            <p>
                To do this, you can simply put an exlamation point (<code>!</code>) before the
                commit type. This will invert the result and instead of checking if a matching
                commit exists, it will check if none exist. Let's add on to our previous example:
            </p>
            <pre><code>[fix] "There was a bug fixed in this update."
[!fix] "There were no bugs fixed in this update.</code></pre>
            <p>
                But the whole point of changelogs is to say what was changed, right? So how do we do
                that?
            </p>
            <p>
                If a <b>positive conditional</b> (checking <em>for</em> a commit) is present, you
                can insert <b>curly brackets</b> (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>). This will loop
                through all matching commits and repeat whatever's inside the curly brackets for all
                commits.
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of this, you can reference the different parts of the commit message by
                putting it between a less than symbol (<code>&lt;</code>) and a greater than symbol
                (<code>&gt;</code>). A very simple changelog syntax would look like:
            </p>
            <pre><code>"# Changelog\n\n"
[fix] "## Bug Fixes\n\n{- &lt;description&gt;\n}\n"
[feat] "## Features\n\n{- &lt;description&gt;\n}\n"
[!feat] "## Features\n\n*No features were added.*"</code></pre>
            <p>
                This will work, but it's not very readable, so it will be hard to make changes to
                it. To fix this, you can use <b>empty lines</b>. That example above will return the
                exact same thing as:
            </p>
            <pre><code>"# Changelog"
"\n\n"

[fix] "## Bug Fixes"
[fix] "{- &lt;description&gt;\n}"
[fix] "\n"


"## Features"
"\n\n"

[feat] "{- &lt;description&gt;\n}"
[feat] "\n"

[!feat] "*No features were added.*"</code></pre>
            <p>
                As you can see, the second one is much more readable. But what if we could make it
                even more readable?
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, we can. We know that if there is no string, there will not be any output. This
                means we can say anything we want outside of a string and conditional, and it will
                have no effect. Let's rewrite the example using <b>comments</b>.
            </p>
            <pre><code>-- TITLE --

"# Changelog"
"\n\n"


-- BUG FIXES --

[fix] "## Bug Fixes" (Title)
[fix] "{- &lt;description&gt;\n}" (List)
[fix] "\n"


-- FEATURES --

"## Features" (Title)
"\n\n"

[feat] "{- &lt;description&gt;\n}" (List)
[feat] "\n"

[!feat] "*No features were added.*" (None)</code></pre>
